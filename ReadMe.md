# User Registraition System

## Project Description

This project is a user resgister system, it allows you to register usernames and passwords to a csv file. then you can login into the app using the restiered credinatals.

The reasons for this project was to test my current knowledge of C++, because i had recently learnt how to code using it. I also wanted to learn how to handle files using this language, because all my projects using this langauge so far havent relyed on outside dependanceys.

i had three challenges with this project, that i overcame. the first was getting to grips with the "<fstream>" header and its functionality, i overcame this by watching and refeering to various tutorials on youtube about it. the second was widthin the "getline" command i coded it like this `getline(ss, un, ",")` instead of this `getline(ss, un, ',')`, because i thought the quote marks and approsthropies were inter-changable. the third challenge i overcame involved previously regsteired credentials being erased, this was overcame when i became aware of the `ios::app` code which can be added to the end of a "offstream" object to write the new data to the end of the file.
